  "Headless runner for Medical Image Processing pipelines with pre-installed packages:
  - [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki), a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data.
  - [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), an open source neuroimaging toolkit for processing, analyzing, and visualizing human brain MR images.
  - [MRtrix3](https://www.mrtrix.org/) provides a set of tools to perform various types of diffusion MRI analyses.
  - [Spinal Cord Toolbox](https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/), a comprehensive, free and open-source set of command-line tools dedicated to the processing and analysis of spinal cord MRI data.
  - [Synb0 Disco](https://github.com/MASILab/Synb0-DISCO#readme), for distortion correction of diffusion weighted MRI without reverse phase-encoding scans or field-maps.
  - Python packages like [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/), [pyvista](https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/), and [cc3d](https://github.com/seung-lab/connected-components-3d#readme).

  This is a computational service designed to run scripts and pipelines in batch mode.
