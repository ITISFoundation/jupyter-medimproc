  "[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) with a variety of Medical Image Processing packages pre-installed, mostly centered on MRI data:
  - [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki), a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data.
  - [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), an open source neuroimaging toolkit for processing, analyzing, and visualizing human brain MR images-
  - [MRtrix3](https://www.mrtrix.org/) provides a set of tools to perform various types of diffusion MRI analyses.
  - [Spinal Cord Toolbox](https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/) (v7.2), a comprehensive, free and open-source set of command-line tools dedicated to the processing and analysis of spinal cord MRI data.
  - [Synb0 Disco](https://github.com/MASILab/Synb0-DISCO#readme), for distortion correction of diffusion weighted MRI without reverse phase-encoding scans or field-maps.
  - Python packages like [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/), [pyvista](https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/), [fsleyes](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes) and [cc3d](https://github.com/seung-lab/connected-components-3d#readme).

  Commands from these packages can be run either from a terminal or from Jupyter Lab (using ! before the command) thus also offering visualization possibilities.
  Either single commands can be run, or full .sh files.
