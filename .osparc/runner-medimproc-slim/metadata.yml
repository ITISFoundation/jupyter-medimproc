  "Optimized headless runner for Medical Image Processing pipelines with selected pre-installed packages:
  - [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki), a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data.
  - [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), an open source neuroimaging toolkit for processing, analyzing, and visualizing human brain MR images.
  - Python packages like [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/) and [cc3d](https://github.com/seung-lab/connected-components-3d#readme).

  This is an optimized computational service with reduced image size, designed to run scripts and pipelines in batch mode.
